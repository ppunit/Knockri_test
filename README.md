# Technology Used
  ReactJS, Redux

# How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?  
  I have used Redux here other than reactJS
  Redux is used to share the states between user listing component and the modal component

# Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
  I will do some improvements in the modal where the video responses are there in that a issue is there if will not pause the video and suddenly changes to the user listing page the video will be disappear and its working at the background so i will imporve that issue

# What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
  1.I will create a backend part with Node JS for this APP where i will save all the user list and    all the users data in the database.
